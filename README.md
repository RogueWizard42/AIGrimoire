## AI Grimoire ðŸ§™âœ¨

A practitioner's collection of useful AI prompts, workflows, and techniques.

#### A Word from the Wizard

This repository is my personal spellbook for the modern age. It's where I document the myriad of useful ways I've found to leverage AI tools in various workflowsâ€”be it as a powerful learning aid, a tireless research assistant, or a creative partner.

#### The Ephemeral Nature of Magic

The world of AI moves at a dizzying pace. A prompt that works wonders this week might be quaint and ineffective the next. Consider this a living document. Spells will be refined, added, and perhaps even redacted as the AI landscape evolves at the speed of thought.

#### The Index

The grimoire is currently organized into the following chapters:

* **[Research](./Research):** Techniques and workflows for using AI as a powerful analysis and discovery tool.
* **[Prompts](./Prompts):** A collection of specific incantations (prompts) for various tasks, including:
    * Learning & Pedagogy
    * Development & Codecraft
    * Content & Creation

*(More chapters will be scribed as the collection grows.)*
