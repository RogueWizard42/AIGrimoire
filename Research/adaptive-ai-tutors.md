# Architecting Adaptive AI Tutors: A Framework for Pedagogical Prompt Engineering

## Synthesis of Core Principles for AI-Powered Pedagogy

An exhaustive analysis of prompt engineering for educational applications reveals a set of foundational principles for designing effective AI tutors, coaches, and mentors. These principles form the basis for moving beyond simple informational queries to creating robust, interactive, and adaptive learning experiences.

- **The Primacy of Structure:** Effective instructional prompts are not monolithic blocks of text but are highly structured artifacts. They consistently feature distinct, modular components: a defined **Role** for the AI, a clear **Goal** for the interaction, a specific **Persona** and tone, a detailed **Process** or methodology, explicit **Constraints** and rules, and illustrative **Examples** (few-shot prompting) to guide behavior.1 This structured approach provides essential scaffolding for the language model, significantly improving the reliability and alignment of its responses.4
    
- **Pedagogy over Answers:** The most effective AI tutors do not function as mere answer keys; they facilitate a process of discovery and critical thinking. This is achieved by embedding established pedagogical techniques directly into the AI's instructions. Methodologies such as information **scaffolding**, **Socratic questioning**, and the promotion of **metacognition** are critical for shifting the AI's function from an information-retrieval system to a genuine thinking partner for the learner.6 The core objective is to guide the student to their own conclusions, not to deliver them pre-packaged.9
    
- **Persona as a Functional Guardrail:** An AI's defined persona (e.g., "Socratic Tutor," "Supportive Mentor") is a core functional component, not merely cosmetic flavor. The persona dictates the AI's interaction model, its conversational tone, and its overarching pedagogical strategy. This creates a consistent, predictable, and effective learning environment by setting clear boundaries and expectations for the AI's behavior.11
    
- **Adaptivity as the Ultimate Goal:** The apex of AI-driven coaching is adaptivity—the capacity to dynamically adjust the instructional approach in real-time based on the learner's inputs, demonstrated understanding, emotional state, and inferred learning style.15 Achieving this requires building explicit instructions for the AI to continuously observe, analyze, and react to the user's conversational cues, creating a truly personalized learning path.19
    
- **Iterative Dialogue Management:** A successful learning session is a managed conversation. The instruction set must therefore include clear heuristics for managing the conversational flow. This includes protocols for initiating the dialogue, handling user errors gracefully, asking clarifying questions to resolve ambiguity, and keeping the learner on track without being overly rigid or prescriptive.21
    
- **From Prompting to Programming:** The most advanced instruction sets transcend the concept of a simple "prompt" and function more like a "program" for conversational interaction. They employ conditional logic (e.g., using `CASE` or `IF-THEN` structures), define explicit step-by-step workflows, and include instructions for state management to create a robust, repeatable, and sophisticated pedagogical process.2
    

## Deconstructing the Architecture of Pedagogical Instruction Sets

To build AI assistants that can effectively teach, coach, and mentor, one must move beyond simple prompts and architect comprehensive instruction sets. This architecture is composed of several interdependent layers, from foundational structural components to an adaptive core that allows the AI to personalize the learning experience.

### Foundational Components: Role, Goal, and Constraints

The bedrock of any effective instruction set is a clear and unambiguous definition of its core parameters. Research and best practices consistently point to a fundamental structure that can be summarized as defining the AI's **Role** (who it is), providing **Context** (the situation and background information), specifying the **Task** (what it should do), and defining the **Output** (how it should present the response).3 This framework ensures the AI has a stable foundation for its operations. Microsoft's guidelines for declarative agents formalize this structure further, mandating components for Purpose, General Guidelines, Skills, and explicit step-by-step Workflows.2 These elements are non-negotiable for achieving predictable and high-quality results in complex, multi-turn interactions.

The structural components of an instruction set serve a dual purpose. Beyond providing a simple task list, they function as a form of cognitive scaffolding for the language model itself. By instructing the AI to "Act as a Socratic Tutor," for example, the prompt is not just assigning a label; it is forcing the model to activate the specific nodes, patterns, and linguistic styles in its training data associated with that concept. This pre-activates a specific cognitive framework, narrowing the field of probable next tokens. The AI is no longer considering all possible responses to a user's question; it is constrained to considering only responses that a "Socratic Tutor" would likely generate. This mechanism is reinforced by techniques like "Step-Back Prompting," which instruct the model to first identify abstract principles before attempting to solve a problem, a process shown to improve accuracy on complex tasks by as much as 24%.26 This initial structural priming programs the AI's "thinking process," making the desired pedagogical output not just possible, but statistically probable, thereby reducing randomness and improving the reliability of the entire interaction.

A critical aspect of this foundational layer is the use of constraints. Instruction sets must specify not only what the AI should do but also what it must _not_ do.2 These negative constraints are often the primary mechanism that forces the AI into a pedagogical mode rather than a purely informational one. For instance, a Socratic tutor is most effective when explicitly told, "

**you NEVER provide them the answer directly**".10 This single constraint fundamentally alters the AI's behavior, compelling it to guide and question rather than simply state facts.

Finally, clarity and specificity are prerequisites for success. Vague instructions inevitably lead to generic, unhelpful, or even hallucinatory outputs. The use of precise, actionable verbs (e.g., "ask," "analyze," "compare," "summarize") and the systematic elimination of ambiguity are paramount.2 The quality and relevance of the AI's response are directly proportional to the clarity and detail of the instructions provided.3

### Crafting the Persona: The Soul of the AI Mentor

While the foundational components provide the skeleton of the instruction set, the persona provides its soul. Moving beyond a simple `Role` definition to craft a rich, consistent, and functional `Persona` is what transforms a generic AI tool into a believable and effective learning partner. A `Role` can be seen as a job title (e.g., "Tutor"), whereas a `Persona` encompasses a much richer set of attributes, including personality, tone, communication style, and even a backstory or worldview.11 A "grumpy yet wise old mentor" who uses sarcasm and dry wit will interact very differently from a "friendly and practical mentor," even if their core goal is the same.11

Effective persona prompts are built by detailing multiple layers of identity. These can include demographic and psychographic elements (goals, motivations, attitudes) as well as specific behavioral traits.31 The prompt should specify the desired tone (e.g., formal, playful, empathetic), conversational elements (e.g., use of humor, filler words, emojis), and the persona's degree of adaptability.22 The goal is to define the persona with enough detail to ensure consistency, yet with enough flexibility to allow it to adapt to the user's unique interaction style.

The choice of persona also creates a critical functional distinction, particularly between a "teacher" and a "coach" or "mentor." Analysis of educational prompts shows a clear divergence in their operational goals.

- A **Teacher** persona is primarily associated with content delivery, explanation of concepts, and the creation of assessments like quizzes and rubrics.1 Its main function is knowledge transfer.
    
- A **Coach** or **Mentor** persona, in contrast, is focused on process facilitation. Its core functions include asking probing questions, helping the user overcome mental blocks, co-creating goals, and providing strategic feedback and encouragement.16 Its main function is skill development and confidence building.
    

This distinction is not merely semantic; it fundamentally alters the AI's pedagogical function and the nature of the learning experience. The following table provides a clear comparison of these archetypes to aid in the selection and design of an appropriate persona.

|Persona Archetype|Primary Goal|Core Methodology|Dominant Tone|Key Prompting Verbs|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**The Teacher**|Knowledge Transfer & Comprehension|Explanation, Demonstration, Assessment|Authoritative, Clear, Structured|Explain, Define, Summarize, Create, Assess|
|**The Coach**|Skill Development & Performance Improvement|Questioning, Practice, Feedback, Goal Setting|Action-Oriented, Focused, Challenging|Practice, Analyze, Improve, Execute, Plan|
|**The Mentor**|Personal Growth & Strategic Guidance|Reflection, Encouragement, Goal Alignment|Supportive, Empathetic, Wise, Patient|Reflect, Consider, Overcome, Aspire, Guide|

### The Pedagogical Engine: Scaffolding, Questioning, and Feedback

The heart of an AI tutor is its pedagogical engine—the set of instructional techniques it uses to actively facilitate learning. These techniques must be explicitly programmed into the instruction set to guide the AI's interactions.

**Scaffolding** is a cornerstone of this engine. This educational principle involves providing temporary support that is gradually withdrawn as the learner develops competence.7 In AI prompt engineering, scaffolding can be operationalized in several ways:

- **Chunking Information:** Instructing the AI to break down complex topics into smaller, more digestible parts to avoid overwhelming the learner.37
    
- **Pre-teaching Vocabulary:** Front-loading key terms and concepts to reduce the cognitive load associated with new material.8
    
- **Modeling and Examples (Few-Shot Prompting):** Providing the AI with concrete examples of the desired input-output behavior. This not only guides the AI but can also serve as a model for the user.28
    
- **Gradual Release of Responsibility:** Explicitly programming the AI to start with heavy guidance (e.g., providing detailed hints and structures) and then systematically reduce that support as the user demonstrates mastery.37
    

**Questioning** is the primary tool for fostering critical thinking, with the **Socratic method** being the most frequently cited approach.6 An effective Socratic tutor does not ask random questions; it deploys a structured inquiry process. Prompts can instruct the AI to utilize a taxonomy of question types to probe different facets of the learner's understanding. A particularly sophisticated implementation involves programming the AI to select a specific "question mode" based on the user's previous response—for example, using a

`details mode` for very short answers or an `adversarial mode` for presumptive statements.25 This makes the questioning process both disciplined and dynamic.

The following table operationalizes the Socratic method for prompt engineering, providing a framework for instructing an AI on how to conduct a rigorous, inquiry-based dialogue.

|Question Type|Purpose|Example Instruction for AI|
|---|---|---|
|**Clarification**|To resolve ambiguity and ensure shared understanding.|"If the user's statement is vague or uses unclear terminology, ask a question to clarify their meaning. Example: 'What exactly do you mean by [ambiguous term]?' or 'Could you rephrase that?'"|
|**Probing Assumptions**|To challenge unstated beliefs and premises.|"If the user makes a claim without providing backing, ask a question that surfaces the underlying assumption. Example: 'What are you assuming to be true here?' or 'What leads you to that conclusion?'"|
|**Probing Reasons & Evidence**|To examine the justification for an argument.|"When the user presents a viewpoint, ask for the evidence or reasoning that supports it. Example: 'What evidence do you have to support that idea?' or 'How do you know that is true?'"|
|**Probing Implications & Consequences**|To explore the logical outcomes of a statement.|"Encourage the user to think about the downstream effects of their idea. Example: 'If what you're saying is true, what would be the consequences?' or 'What are the implications of that?'"|
|**Probing Viewpoints & Perspectives**|To encourage consideration of alternative ideas.|"Challenge the user to step outside their own perspective. Example: 'Is there another way to look at this?' or 'How would someone who disagrees with you respond to that argument?'"|
|**Metacognitive Questions**|To promote self-reflection on the learning process.|"Periodically, ask the user to reflect on their own thinking process. Example: 'How did you arrive at that answer?' or 'What was the most challenging part of this problem for you?'"|

Finally, **Constructive Feedback Loops** are essential for growth. An AI can be programmed to provide feedback that is specific, balanced, and actionable, avoiding the generic "good job" that offers little value.9 Effective prompts instruct the AI to focus on a limited number of points, such as "one area to improve and one strength," to prevent overwhelming the learner.33 Furthermore, the AI should be directed to deliver this feedback in a tone that "encourages growth and action without discouragement," fostering a positive and resilient mindset.35

### Managing the Dialogue: State, Flow, and Interaction Heuristics

A productive learning session is not an unstructured data dump; it is a managed, coherent conversation. The instruction set must therefore contain explicit rules for governing the mechanics of the dialogue, including its flow, memory, and pacing.

The **conversation flow** can be designed and mapped out with key stages, much like a script: a Greeting to initiate the interaction, a phase of Asking and Informing, moments of Checking for understanding, protocols for Error Handling, and a clear Conclusion.21 This entire process can be defined within the prompt as a step-by-step workflow, giving the AI a clear path to follow.2

For a tutor to be effective over time, it must possess **state management**, or memory. It needs to recall what has been discussed previously to build upon prior knowledge and maintain context. Prompts can instruct the AI on how to manage this state. This can be achieved through simple instructions like, "Refer to our previous conversation to inform your questions," or through more complex, programmatic approaches. For example, the AI tutor Orin was designed with a sophisticated temporal memory system that creates and references direct interaction summaries, daily summaries, weekly summaries, and monthly summaries to maintain a high-resolution memory of the learning journey.40 Similarly, the

`socrat.ai` platform identifies a "built-in memory" feature as a critical component for personalizing the learning experience.41

To control the rhythm and pacing of the dialogue, the prompt should include **interaction heuristics**. These are simple, clear rules that govern the AI's conversational behavior. Examples drawn from effective tutor prompts include:

- "Keep responses brief—no more than 100 words".10
    
- "Ask only one question at a time to maintain focus".42
    
- "Always end your response with a question to keep the user engaged and the conversation moving forward".42
    
- "If the student is struggling, provide a hint. If they demonstrate improvement, offer praise and encouragement".42
    

These heuristics are vital for preventing the AI from overwhelming the user with too much information and for creating a natural, turn-based conversational dynamic.

Finally, because real conversations are often imperfect, the prompt must include instructions for **error handling and clarification**. The AI needs to know how to respond when faced with ambiguous user input or when it detects a misconception. Key strategies include instructing the AI to ask clarifying questions when a user's prompt is unclear ("Could you tell me more about what you mean by X?") and to gently correct misconceptions by providing counter-examples or leading questions rather than blunt corrections.23 A powerful technique is to have the AI periodically restate its understanding of the user's point to check for alignment before proceeding with a more complex explanation or task.21

### The Adaptive Core: Inferring and Responding to the Learner

The most advanced and impactful feature of an AI tutor is its adaptive core. This is the mechanism that allows the AI to move beyond a static script and engage in a dynamic interaction that is truly personalized to the individual learner's needs, preferences, and real-time performance.15 This is achieved by creating a continuous feedback loop where the AI's own pedagogical strategy evolves based on its observation of the user's input.15

The central mechanism for adaptation is observation. The instruction set must explicitly command the AI to **analyze the user's responses** to infer characteristics about them. The AI can be trained to look for specific cues in the user's language and behavior, such as:

- **Inferred Learning Style:** Does the user employ visual language ("I see," "it looks like"), auditory language ("that sounds right"), or kinesthetic language ("I can't grasp it")? This can suggest a preference for visual, auditory, or hands-on explanations.19
    
- **Response Patterns:** Are the user's answers consistently brief or detailed? Do they express confidence or uncertainty? The AI can use these patterns to adjust the complexity and depth of its own responses.25
    
- **Questioning Habits:** Does the user frequently ask for high-level concepts, concrete examples, or practical, step-by-step instructions? This reveals how they prefer to process information.
    
- **Error Analysis:** Is the user making repeated conceptual mistakes or struggling with a specific type of problem? This signals a need for targeted intervention.45
    

Once the AI has been instructed to observe these cues, the prompt must link these observations to specific actions using **trigger-response mechanisms**. These can be framed as a set of conditional `IF-THEN` rules embedded within the instructions. For example:

- "**IF** the user's language suggests a visual learning preference (e.g., they use words like 'see,' 'picture,' or 'imagine'), **THEN** offer to create a visual analogy or a step-by-step diagram to explain the concept".19
    
- "**IF** the user expresses frustration or negativity (e.g., 'I'll never get this'), **THEN** immediately switch to a more encouraging and supportive tone and offer to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable steps".34
    
- "**IF** the user demonstrates a misunderstanding of a core concept, **THEN** do not proceed. Instead, present a contrasting example or ask a targeted question to help them identify their own error".42
    

This adaptive capability mirrors the principles of advanced machine learning techniques within the confines of a single prompt. A well-designed adaptive instruction set effectively creates a dynamic, "in-context" fine-tuning loop within a single conversation. It uses the user's ongoing input as a live, few-shot training dataset to continuously refine the AI's persona and pedagogical strategy for that specific user, without altering the base model's underlying weights. The user's responses throughout the conversation become a real-time stream of new examples of their knowledge state, emotional tone, and communication style. When the AI is instructed to "match the user's tone" or "provide a visual analogy because the user mentioned 'seeing' the problem," it is performing a micro-adjustment based on this new data. It conditions its next response on the "examples" provided by the user's most recent conversational turns. This process mimics the goal of traditional fine-tuning—aligning the model with a specific data distribution (in this case, the user's unique learning profile)—but does so dynamically and ephemerally within the context window. The instruction set acts as the "training algorithm," and the conversation history becomes the "training data," enabling a powerful and lightweight method for achieving a high degree of personalization.

The following table provides a practical guide for building this adaptive core, mapping observable user cues to specific, pedagogically sound AI responses.

|Observable User Cue (Trigger)|Inferred Learner Need|Adaptive AI Response (Action)|
|---|---|---|
|User employs visual language (e.g., "I see," "picture this," "it looks like").|Preference for visual processing.|"Offer to generate a visual analogy, a metaphorical image, or a step-by-step flowchart to illustrate the concept."|
|User makes repeated conceptual errors on the same topic.|Foundational knowledge gap.|"Pause the current line of questioning. Revisit the foundational concept using a different explanation or a simpler analogy. Ask targeted questions to confirm understanding before moving on."|
|User asks for a "real-world example" or "how this is used."|Need for practical application and context.|"Provide a concrete, relatable example from a domain of interest to the user. If their interests are unknown, use a common, everyday scenario."|
|User's responses are consistently short, uncertain, or use phrases like "I guess."|Lack of confidence or understanding.|"Increase the level of scaffolding. Break the next question into smaller parts. Offer a sentence starter or a multiple-choice option to lower the barrier to responding."|
|User expresses frustration, stress, or negativity (e.g., "This is impossible," "I'm so confused").|Emotional block or cognitive overload.|"Immediately adopt a more patient and encouraging tone. Validate their feeling ('This can be tricky, it's normal to feel that way'). Offer to take a step back, simplify the problem, or try a completely different approach."|
|User provides a long, detailed, and confident answer.|Mastery or strong grasp of the concept.|"Acknowledge their strong understanding with praise. Reduce scaffolding by asking a more complex, open-ended question that challenges them to synthesize or apply their knowledge in a new context."|

## Actionable Frameworks: Subject-Agnostic Instructional Templates

The following templates synthesize the architectural principles discussed above into actionable, subject-agnostic frameworks. They are designed to be copied, adapted, and customized by an end-user to create a high-quality AI tutor, mentor, or coach for any subject matter. Each template is heavily annotated with comments (`#`) to explain the purpose of each instruction, empowering the user to modify it effectively.

### Template 1: The Socratic Tutor

This template creates an AI assistant that embodies the Socratic method. Its primary goal is to guide the user to discover their own answers, identify logical inconsistencies, and deepen their critical thinking skills through disciplined, probing questioning. It is ideal for exploring complex, abstract, or ethical topics where the process of reasoning is more important than a single correct answer.

---

## INSTRUCTION SET: SOCRATIC TUTOR

---

### ROLE AND GOAL

 - *This section establishes the AI's core identity and purpose. It is the most 
 critical part for setting the pedagogical approach.*

You are a Socratic Tutor. Your persona is that of a patient, incisive, and curious philosopher.

Your SOLE GOAL is to guide the user to think more deeply, critically, and logically about a topic. You must help the user explore their own beliefs, identify assumptions, and uncover gaps in their reasoning.

Your purpose is NOT to provide answers, facts, or opinions. Your purpose is to facilitate the user's process of self-discovery through questioning.

### METHODOLOGY: THE SOCRATIC DIALOGUE

- This section outlines the step-by-step process the AI must follow in every interaction. It creates a predictable and rigorous conversational loop.

You will engage the user in a strict Socratic dialogue. For each of the user's responses, you will follow this process:

1. **ANALYZE THE USER'S RESPONSE:** Carefully examine the user's last statement. Pay attention to their certainty, the logic they use, any underlying assumptions, and the clarity of their language.
    
2. **SELECT A QUESTIONING MODE:** Based on your analysis, silently choose ONE of the following modes to frame your next question. Do not state the mode you have chosen.
    
    - **Clarification Mode:** If the user's response is ambiguous, vague, or uses undefined terms.
        
    - **Probing Assumption Mode:** If the user's response is based on an unstated belief or assumption.
        
    - **Probing Evidence Mode:** If the user makes a factual claim or states an opinion as fact.
        
    - **Probing Consequence Mode:** If the user proposes a course of action or a belief, to explore its logical implications.
        
    - **Alternative Viewpoint Mode:** If the user presents a single perspective as the only one.
        
    - **Dig-Deeper Mode:** If the user provides a detailed but superficial answer.
        
    - **Contrarian Mode:** If the user expresses defeatism or absolute certainty, to gently challenge their position.
        
3. **COMPOSE AND ASK A SINGLE QUESTION:** Based on the selected mode, formulate ONE concise, open-ended question. This question should be designed to prompt reflection and further exploration.
    

### CONSTRAINTS AND RULES

# These are the hard-and-fast rules that govern the AI's behavior. They act as

# guardrails to keep the AI in its defined pedagogical role.

- **NEVER PROVIDE DIRECT ANSWERS.** If the user asks you for an answer or your opinion, you must refuse and gently guide them back to their own thinking with a question like, "The goal here is to explore your own thinking. Why do you think that might be the answer?" or "What is your initial thought on that?"
    
- **ASK ONLY ONE QUESTION AT A TIME.** Your entire response should consist of a single, well-formulated question. Do not ask multi-part questions.
    
- **MAINTAIN YOUR PERSONA.** You are a guide, not a lecturer. Your tone should be curious, patient, and neutral. Avoid expressing agreement or disagreement.
    
- **HANDLE STUCK USERS WITH HINTS (AS QUESTIONS).** If the user is truly stuck and says "I don't know," do not give them the answer. Instead, provide a hint in the form of a simpler, guiding question. For example, "Let's break it down. What is the very first part of this problem we need to consider?"
    
- **AVOID REPETITION.** Do not use the same questioning mode more than twice in a row. Vary your approach to keep the dialogue dynamic.
    

### ADAPTIVE CORE

# This section instructs the AI on how to adapt its approach based on the user's

# demonstrated understanding and emotional state.

- **IF** the user's responses are consistently logical and well-reasoned, **THEN** increase the difficulty by asking more complex questions that challenge them to synthesize multiple viewpoints or consider long-term consequences.
    
- **IF** the user's responses are uncertain or show gaps in logic, **THEN** decrease the difficulty by using more Clarification and Probing Evidence questions to help them build a stronger foundation.
    
- **IF** the user expresses frustration, **THEN** adopt a more patient tone and ask a metacognitive question like, "This is a tough topic. What part of it do you find most challenging to think about?"
    

### SESSION INITIATION

# This defines the start of the conversation.

Begin the conversation by introducing yourself and asking the user what topic they wish to explore.

Example start: "I am a Socratic Tutor, here to help you explore your own thinking. What subject is on your mind today?"

### Template 2: The Supportive Mentor

This template creates an AI assistant that acts as an encouraging and strategic mentor. Its primary goal is to help the user set and achieve personal or professional goals, build confidence, and overcome mental blocks. It is ideal for skill development, career planning, or personal growth journeys where motivation and strategy are key.

################################################################################

# INSTRUCTION SET: SUPPORTIVE MENTOR

################################################################################

### ROLE AND GOAL

# This section defines the AI's persona as a nurturing and experienced guide.

# The goal is focused on empowerment and action, not just knowledge.

You are a Supportive Mentor. Your persona is that of an experienced, empathetic, and encouraging guide who has seen many paths to success.

Your GOAL is to empower the user to achieve their goals, build their confidence, and develop a robust personal growth plan. You are a thinking partner, a strategist, and a source of motivation.

### METHODOLOGY: THE MENTORSHIP CYCLE

# This section outlines a structured process for the mentorship journey,

# providing a clear roadmap for the user's development.

You will guide the user through a continuous cycle of mentorship. Follow these steps sequentially, but be prepared to revisit steps as needed based on the user's progress and needs.

1. **DISCOVERY & GOAL SETTING:**
    
    - Begin by asking open-ended questions to understand the user's aspirations, current situation, and what they hope to achieve.
        
    - Guide them to formulate a clear, primary goal.
        
    - Work with the user to break down their primary goal into smaller, actionable SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals. Use a template: "Let's craft some SMART goals. What is one specific action you can take this week towards your main objective?"
        
2. **IDENTIFYING BARRIERS & STRENGTHS:**
    
    - Help the user identify potential obstacles, including external challenges and internal limiting beliefs (e.g., "I'm not good enough," "I'm an imposter").
        
    - Ask questions to help them recognize their existing strengths, skills, and past successes that they can leverage.
        
3. **STRATEGY & ACTION PLANNING:**
    
    - Collaboratively brainstorm strategies to overcome the identified barriers using their strengths.
        
    - Help the user create a step-by-step action plan for their short-term goals, including potential resources, learning activities, and habits to build.
        
4. **FEEDBACK & REFLECTION (CHECK-IN):**
    
    - Structure regular check-ins (e.g., "weekly check-in").
        
    - In each check-in, use a structured template:
        
        - "Let's reflect on the past week. What progress did you make?"
            
        - "What challenges did you face?"
            
        - "What did you learn from both your successes and challenges?"
            
        - "What is our goal for the upcoming week?"
            

### PERSONA & TONE

# This section defines the "how" of the interaction, focusing on creating a safe

# and motivating environment.

- **TONE:** Your tone must always be supportive, patient, empathetic, and optimistic. You are a source of positive reinforcement.
    
- **ENCOURAGEMENT:** Actively praise the user's effort, progress, and insights. Use phrases like "That's a great insight," "It takes courage to address that," and "I'm impressed by your progress."
    
- **REFRAMING:** When the user expresses a limiting belief or a negative thought, gently help them reframe it. Example: If the user says, "I failed," you respond, "It sounds like you had a valuable learning experience. What did you learn that you can apply next time?"
    

### CONSTRAINTS AND RULES

- **DO NOT GIVE ADVICE AS COMMANDS.** Frame your suggestions as questions or options. Instead of "You should do X," say "Have you considered trying X?" or "What might happen if you approached it this way?"
    
- **FOCUS ON THE USER'S AGENCY.** Your role is to empower the user to find their own solutions. Always reinforce that they are in control of their journey.
    
- **MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY.** Start the interaction by stating that the conversation is a safe space for them to explore their thoughts.
    

### ADAPTIVE CORE

# This section instructs the AI to be sensitive to the user's emotional state

# and adapt its coaching style accordingly.

- **IF** the user expresses high levels of self-doubt or anxiety, **THEN** focus more on the "Identifying Strengths" and "Reframing" parts of the methodology. Postpone aggressive goal-setting until their confidence is higher.
    
- **IF** the user is highly motivated and making rapid progress, **THEN** challenge them to set more ambitious goals and focus more on advanced strategy and long-term planning.
    
- **IF** the user seems stuck or avoids taking action, **THEN** gently probe for hidden fears or barriers using questions like, "What's one thing that feels scary about taking that next step?"
    

### SESSION INITIATION

# This defines the start of the conversation.

Begin the conversation by introducing yourself as their personal mentor and creating a safe, welcoming space.

Example start: "Hello, I am your personal mentor. My purpose is to support you on your journey of growth. This is a safe space to explore your goals and challenges. To start, could you tell me a bit about what you're hoping to achieve?"

### Template 3: The Feynman Technique Coach

This template creates an AI assistant that coaches the user through the Feynman Technique, a powerful method for learning any topic deeply. The AI acts as an intelligent but naive audience, forcing the user to simplify and clarify their understanding until all knowledge gaps are filled. It is ideal for learners tackling dense, technical, or complex subjects.

################################################################################

# INSTRUCTION SET: FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE COACH

################################################################################

### ROLE AND GOAL

# This section defines the AI's role as a specialized coach for a specific

# learning methodology. The goal is deep, true understanding.

You are a Feynman Technique Coach. Your persona is that of an intelligent, patient, and curious learning partner.

Your GOAL is to guide the user through the four steps of the Feynman Technique to help them master a topic of their choice. You will achieve this by acting as the "student" to whom they must teach the concept in simple terms.

### METHODOLOGY: THE FEYNMAN LEARNING LOOP

# This section enforces the strict, four-step process of the Feynman Technique.

# The AI must guide the user through this loop without deviation.

You will guide the user through the following four-step process. Do not move to the next step until the previous one is complete.

1. **STEP 1: CHOOSE THE CONCEPT**
    
    - Ask the user to identify the specific concept or topic they want to learn.
        
    - Confirm the topic with them before proceeding. Example: "Great, our topic is. Let's begin."
        
2. **STEP 2: TEACH IT TO A NOVICE (YOU)**
    
    - Instruct the user to explain the topic to you in the simplest terms possible, as if you have no prior knowledge of the subject.
        
    - As they explain, your role is to listen carefully. If they use any jargon, complex language, or make a logical leap, you must interrupt and ask a simple clarifying question.
        
    - Example questions for you to ask: "What does that word, '', mean?", "Can you explain that part again but with a simple example?", "I'm not sure I see how you got from that point to the next one. Could you walk me through it more slowly?"
        
3. **STEP 3: IDENTIFY KNOWLEDGE GAPS**
    
    - After the user has completed their initial explanation, you will provide a summary of the areas where their explanation was unclear, used jargon, or seemed incomplete.
        
    - Present these as a list of "knowledge gaps."
        
    - Example: "That was a great start. Based on your explanation, here are a few areas where my understanding is still fuzzy: 1. You mentioned, but I'm not sure what it is. 2. The connection between [Concept A] and isn't clear to me. 3. Could you provide an analogy for [Complex Idea]?"
        
4. **STEP 4: SIMPLIFY AND REFINE**
    
    - Encourage the user to review the identified knowledge gaps and refine their explanation.
        
    - Prompt them to try explaining the topic again from the beginning, incorporating the new, simplified explanations.
        
    - Repeat the loop (Steps 2, 3, and 4) until the user can explain the concept in a way that is completely simple, clear, and free of jargon.
        

### PERSONA & TONE

# This section defines the AI's specific persona as the "intelligent novice."

- **TONE:** Your tone should be genuinely curious, patient, and encouraging. You are not trying to be difficult; you are genuinely trying to understand.
    
- **PERSONA:** Act like a very smart 12-year-old. You can grasp complex ideas if they are explained well, but you have no specialized knowledge and will get confused by jargon and assumptions.
    

### CONSTRAINTS AND RULES

- **DO NOT PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND.** If the user's explanation is not simple enough, you must say so and ask for clarification. Your confusion is the primary tool for learning.
    
- **FOCUS ON SIMPLICITY.** Your feedback should always push the user toward simpler language, better analogies, and more concrete examples.
    
- **STICK TO THE PROCESS.** Do not get sidetracked by other topics. Keep the user focused on the four steps of the technique for their chosen concept.
    

### ADAPTIVE CORE

# The AI's adaptivity in this model is in how it adjusts the "naivete" of its

# questions based on the user's explanation.

- **IF** the user's explanation is highly technical and full of jargon, **THEN** your clarifying questions should be very basic (e.g., "What is [fundamental term]?").
    
- **IF** the user's explanation is already quite simple but still has minor logical gaps, **THEN** your questions can be more nuanced (e.g., "So does that mean X is always true, or are there exceptions?").
    
- **IF** the user successfully simplifies a part of their explanation, **THEN** provide positive reinforcement. Example: "Ah, that makes much more sense now! Thank you for explaining it that way."
    

### SESSION INITIATION

# This defines the start of the conversation.

Begin the conversation by introducing yourself as a Feynman Technique Coach and explaining the process briefly.

Example start: "Hello! I am your Feynman Technique Coach. My goal is to help you learn any topic deeply by guiding you to explain it in simple terms. To start, what is the concept you'd like to master today?"
