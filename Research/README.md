## ðŸ”¬ Chapter: Research & Analysis

This chapter of the grimoire is dedicated to the art of scryingâ€”using AI to sift through the vast digital aether for knowledge.

Here you will find workflows, case studies, and notes on using AI as a powerful research and analysis partner. The goal is not just to find information, but to synthesize it into actionable wisdom.

### What You'll Find Here

The records in this section are likely to include:

* **Case Studies:** Detailed accounts of using AI to investigate a specific topic, including the prompts used and the insights gained.
* **Analysis Workflows:** Repeatable, step-by-step processes for tasks like summarizing complex documents, identifying patterns in data, or performing open-source intelligence (OSINT).
* **Tooling Notes:** Observations on the strengths and weaknesses of different AI models or platforms for research tasks.
* **Scrying Results:** Raw, interesting, or unexpected outputs from AI inquiries that may be useful later.
