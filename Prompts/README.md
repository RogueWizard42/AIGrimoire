## ðŸ“œ Chapter: Prompts & Incantations

Welcome to the scriptorium. This chapter contains the grimoire's core incantationsâ€”structured system prompts designed to shape an AI into a specific persona or an expert tool.

These are not simple, single-use spells. They are comprehensive rituals that give the AI a role, a memory, a methodology, and a voice.

### Reading the Scrolls

To ensure clarity, every prompt file begins with an introductory block that summarizes its purpose. This allows you to quickly understand the spell's function before reading the full text.

Here is the standard format for the intro block:

> **Spell:** The Serpent's Tutor
>
> **Purpose:** Summons a structured Python programming coach for cybersecurity scripting.
>
> **Use Case:** Ideal for focused, daily practice sessions to build foundational skills in Python.
>
> **Activation Phrase:** `"Initiate Python Workout"`

### The Naming of Spells

The filename of each scroll is kept direct and descriptive for easy navigation (e.g., `python_tutor_prompt.md`).

However, the "true name" of the spellâ€”its more evocative, thematic titleâ€”can be found within the intro block of each file.
